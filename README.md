# joplin-theme

My adaptation of [stysebae's "joplin-vsc-material-theme"](https://github.com/stysebae/joplin-vsc-material-theme).

Make sure you have [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) and [Consalas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas) installed. Set them as your editor and code fonts in Joplin, and select dark mode.
