# joplin-theme

My adaptation of [stysebae's "joplin-vsc-material-theme"](https://github.com/stysebae/joplin-vsc-material-theme). Some of the main things were to ...
1. Make written markdown look much like rendered markdown, and thereby reduce the need to switch between views.
2. Soften the colors
3. Draw attention toward the editor and rendered text, by making the rest less visually intrusive

Make sure you have [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) and [Consalas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/consolas) installed. Set them as your editor and code fonts in Joplin, and select dark mode.
